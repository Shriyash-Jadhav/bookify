				<p style={{ fontSize: "16px", color: "#4b4b4b" }}>
					We a group of friends started Bookify because there was a major problem faced which was faced by most of the Engineering during their college times regarding how to find or where to find a particular subject book related to a specific author because most of the time, the books shops didnâ€™t have that author books or they would say that it will take a month or week to arrive. And then if you see, how will the student wait for a week or month when exams are going to take in just a week.
					That's why we came to a solution of creating a web portal for students where they can visit and just select which book, they want just through some single clicks and no need to wait for week or month, we provide you the books with fast-delivery option.
